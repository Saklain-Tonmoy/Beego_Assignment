#### How to install go and beego
 ###### step 1
 - First confirm that youâ€™re in the home directory
 ```bash
   cd ~
```
###### step 2
- Then use curl to retrieve the tarball, 
 ```bash
  curl -OL https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
###### step 3
- To verify the integrity of the file you downloaded, run the sha256sum command and pass it to the filename as an argument
 ```bash
  sha256sum go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz

```


###### step 4
- Next, use tar to extract the tarball. This command includes the -C flag which instructs tar to change to the given directory before performing any other operations
```bash
 sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf go1.16.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz

```

- In this step, you will set paths in your environment.

export GOPATH="/home/yourpcname/go/"
export GOBIN="/home/yourpcname/go/bin"

```
- After youâ€™ve added this information to your profile, save and close the file. If you used nano, do so by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, and then ENTER.
